# Global Warming - Fact or Fiction?

## Background information - Synthesis of Contrasting Perspectives on Global Warming
There is a lot of debate about global warming. Global warming presents a complex challenge characterized by rising temperatures and shifting climatic patterns, primarily attributed to increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities. Here are some  prevailing scientific viewpoints and critical perspectives, offering a somewhat balanced understanding to guide an effective  discussion and exporation of this topic.
### Key Points:
1.	Role of Greenhouse Gases:
o	Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are central to the enhanced greenhouse effect, driving global temperature increases (IPCC, 2021).
o	Critics argue that the focus on CO2 might overshadow other significant natural and environmental factors, such as solar radiation and volcanic activity, suggesting a need for broader climate modeling (Curry, 2017).
2.	Evidence of Rising Temperatures:
o	Data from the past 50 years indicate the highest global surface temperatures in recorded history, underlining a clear warming trend (NASA, 2020).
o	There is caution against over-reliance on predictive models, which may not capture the full spectrum of natural climate variability, highlighting the necessity for ongoing model refinement (Curry, 2017).
3.	Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies:
o	Current strategies predominantly focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through technologies and regulatory measures, including renewable energy adoption and carbon capture (IPCC, 2021).
o	There is a strong case for integrating adaptation strategies to enhance resilience against climate impacts, particularly in vulnerable communities, emphasizing the need for immediate and actionable adaptation measures (Nordhaus, 2013).
4.	Equity and Policy Implications:
o	International efforts, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to reduce global emissions but must consider the differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries (UNFCCC, 2015).
o	Policies should acknowledge historical emissions from developed nations and the developmental prerogatives of emerging economies to ensure fairness and effectiveness (Chinweikpe, 2023).
Conclusion: To address global warming comprehensively, it is essential to embrace a multi-faceted approach that combines emission reduction with robust adaptation strategies. This approach should incorporate both scientific consensus and critical insights to foster policies that are not only effective in mitigating climate change but also equitable across different global communities.

# Project Overview 
This project examines various environmental data sets for increases in the rise of surface temperature and 
the impact of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses for evidence of global warming and possible correlations. 

## Project Goals 
Find and examine various environmental data to see the impact of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses for evidence of global warming and possible correlations
1. Explore the temperature change of different countries and different continents over a 25-year span (1995 – 2020) 
2. Examine CO2 emissions as it relates to increases in surface temperature
3. Explore possible predication models for increases in surface temperature using country data. 

## Project Scope: We will create 6-8 data visualizations to help answer these questions. 

## Visualizations 
1. Min/Max Difference in Temp by Country 1995 - 2020 - paredo
2. Min/Max Difference in CO2 by Country 1995 -2020 - paredo
3. Temperature difference by Contient - Bar graph 
4. Scatter Plot of Average Temp & Average CO2 Increase by Country
higher levels of CO2 stays at the higher levels - less variability and more predictability 
5. Average Temp Over Time by Country - line chart
6. Average Temperature Over Time by Continent - line chart
7. Average CO2 EmissionsOver Time by Continent - line chart
8. Forecasting x 3 with and without the year 2021
9. Coorelation Heat Map

## Results/Summary of the Analysis




## Detailed Usage and Installation Instructions
3 data sets are associated with this project.
All data files are .cvs files. 
One data set was very large and we had to do something special with it. 

## Data Sets
1. [Global Warming Trends (1961-2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadawan/global-warming-trends-1961-2022)
Country, ISO code, Year and Temperature 
Country wise surface temperature from 1961 to 2022
2. [Countries and their Continents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hserdaraltan/countries-by-continent)
Temperature (1960) to Temperature (2022): annual surface temp (C) from1960 to 2022 
3. [Temperature of all countries from 1995 to 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/temperature-of-all-countries-19952020) 
Contains data of various major cities of different countries in the world.
